# Project Name

## Overview

Our team, Ashmeet, Esin, and Blair are developing an application to help people who are concerned with their health, and developing diabetes, make more informed decisions about what they buy at the grocery store by giving users the ability to scan the food they see at the grocery store, and receive metrics about how it may affect their health.
Example:

This application lets users share their knowledge on foods which they know will help them with their health condition.

Developed for the [Comp 1800] course, applying User-Centred Design practices, agile project management processes, integrating a weather API, and Firebase backend services.
